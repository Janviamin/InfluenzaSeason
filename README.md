# Influenza Season Staffing Analysis for Medical Staffing Agency
Project Overview
This project aims to help a medical staffing agency proactively plan staffing needs for clinics and hospitals across the United States during influenza season. By analyzing trends in influenza, particularly in vulnerable populations, we aim to develop a staffing plan that minimizes both understaffing and overstaffing to ensure adequate patient care.

## Objectives
Timing & Distribution of Staff: Determine when and where additional staff are needed based on influenza trends.  
Seasonal Analysis: Identify if influenza season starts and ends consistently across states.    
Vulnerable Population Prioritization: Classify states as low-, medium-, or high-need based on their vulnerable population count.  
Data Limitations: Address any data limitations that might affect analysis and recommendations.  

## Key Success Factors
An optimized staffing plan that efficiently allocates available personnel. 
Minimal cases of understaffing or overstaffing across states.  
Prioritization of high-need states to ensure vulnerable populations are adequately served.  

## Data Sources
This project integrates data from multiple sources:  
 
CDC Influenza Deaths by Geography: Historical death data as an indicator of flu severity.  
US Census Population Data: Age, gender, and state-specific population data to estimate vulnerable populations.  
CDC Lab Test Results by State: Influenza test results to assess flu prevalence.  
CDC Flu Shot Rates in Children: Survey data on vaccination rates to correlate with flu outcomes.  

## Analysis Approach
Data Cleaning & Integration: Merge datasets from different sources and ensure consistency.  
Hypothesis Testing: Formulate and test hypotheses, such as "higher flu-shot rates correlate with lower hospitalizations."  
Correlation Analysis: Explore relationships between influenza severity, vulnerable populations, and flu-shot rates.  
Spatial & Temporal Visualization: Use maps and timelines to visualize flu trends across states and months.  
Recommendations: Develop staffing recommendations based on insights from data analysis.  

## Deliverables  
Data Cleaning Report: Documenting data preparation steps.  
Analytical Insights: Findings on flu season patterns and vulnerable population impacts.  
Staffing Recommendations: A state-by-state staffing plan.  
Final Presentation: A visually engaging summary tailored for stakeholders, including administrators and healthcare professionals.
